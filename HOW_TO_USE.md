To use these tools at there 100% potential you need to understand how all of these fit in the flow and how to explain that to LLM until I perfect the description and names of all tools and make it self-explanatory for most LLMs.


Suppose I want to Integarte an API that is setup. i will write a prompt that will instruct the LLM to use "searchApiDocs" tool to get the expected payload and request type then it can start writing code based on the memory you have setup. It can make new pages/modules/sub-modules etc if that is how you have steuctured yout project. It can define types, use helper functions and custom hooks that you have setup based on memory. I have seen almost 80-90% accuracy using this method in jS projects and 60-70% accuracy in typescript projects( most of the time it makes mistake of assigning wrong types or making duplicate type).

I use these tools along with context7 so tht if i have to integrate a new type of API then based on the component library i am using it can read it's docs and make new components and pages based on the need for data displaying. If you want good UI then you can use google's 2.5 pro model and the 2 screenshot tools for taking screenshots and analyze them to improve the UI. For CSS debugging i use "getSelectedElement" tool. After Integrating an API if there is a change in response or if there are any errors then "analyzeApiCalls" will be useful there to fetch the requests and responses and analyze them to find the issue.

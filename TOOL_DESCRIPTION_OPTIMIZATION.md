# Tool Description Optimization for Coding Agents

## Problem
Original tool descriptions were written for human developers, containing too much information that overwhelms coding agents.

## Solution
Simplified descriptions focus only on what agents need to know:
- **What the tool does** (concisely)
- **When to use it** (workflow context)
- **No configuration details** (agents assume environment is set up)

## Before vs After Examples

### executeAuthenticatedApiCall

**BEFORE (Overwhelming):**
```
üöÄ WHEN TO USE: Execute authenticated API calls automatically. This tool: 1) Retrieves auth tokens from browser session using predefined environment configuration, 2) Executes API requests with proper authentication headers, 3) Returns structured response data for analysis. Perfect for testing API behavior, validating responses, and understanding actual API data structures. 

üìã WORKFLOW INTEGRATION: Use AFTER searchApiDocs to test discovered endpoints with real authentication. Results provide actual API response structure for accurate TypeScript interface design and data handling logic. Eliminates token retrieval hallucination and ensures consistent API testing. 

üí° CONFIGURATION: Requires AUTH_ORIGIN, AUTH_STORAGE_TYPE, AUTH_TOKEN_KEY, and API_BASE_URL environment variables for automatic token retrieval and API calls.
```

**AFTER (Agent-Friendly):**
```
Execute authenticated API calls and get real response data. Use this to test API endpoints with actual authentication and understand the real response structure for accurate TypeScript interfaces. Call this after using searchApiDocs to validate endpoints with live data.
```

### searchApiDocs

**BEFORE (Too Detailed):**
```
üîç WHEN TO USE: Essential for frontend development workflows. Use this tool to: 1) Find specific API endpoints for features you're implementing (e.g., user auth, data CRUD, file uploads), 2) Discover correct request/response formats and required parameters, 3) Identify authentication requirements for API calls, 4) Find endpoints by functionality using tags or patterns, 5) Get parameter schemas for TypeScript interface design and form validation. 

üìã WORKFLOW INTEGRATION: Use AFTER discoverApiStructure to understand available tags and API organization. Results inform TypeScript interface design and API integration planning. Follow with executeAuthenticatedApiCall to test discovered endpoints with real authentication and validate actual response structures. Use analyzeApiCalls for debugging network behavior. 

üí° SEARCH STRATEGIES: Search by entity names, functional patterns, HTTP methods, or tags. Use comprehensive search to explore related endpoints. Document findings for team knowledge sharing. Requires SWAGGER_URL environment variable pointing to your API documentation.
```

**AFTER (Clear & Concise):**
```
Search API documentation to find endpoints, parameters, and response schemas. Use this to discover available API endpoints for the features you're implementing. Follow with executeAuthenticatedApiCall to test endpoints with real data.
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Removed Configuration Details**: Agents don't need to know about AUTH_ORIGIN, SWAGGER_URL, etc.
2. **Simplified Language**: No emojis, bullet points, or complex formatting
3. **Focus on Function**: What it does, when to use it, what comes next
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: From 200+ words to 20-30 words per description
5. **Clear Workflow**: Simple sequence instructions (use X after Y)

## Benefits for Agents

‚úÖ **Less overwhelming**: Shorter, focused descriptions  
‚úÖ **Clearer decision making**: When to use each tool  
‚úÖ **Better workflow**: Simple A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C instructions  
‚úÖ **Reduced hallucination**: No complex configuration to misinterpret  
‚úÖ **Faster processing**: Less text to parse and understand  

This approach treats the environment configuration as invisible infrastructure that agents don't need to worry about, similar to how they don't need to know about network protocols when making API calls.
